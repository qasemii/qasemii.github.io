Greetings! I am Mohammad Reza Ghasemi Madani (Reza), a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Melbourne, supervised by [Dr Caren Han](https://drcarenhan.github.io/) and [Dr Jey Han Lau](https://jeyhan.my/). I was previously a researcher at the [SML Group](https://sml.disi.unitn.it/) at the University of Trento, working with [Dr. Andrea Passerini](https://disi.unitn.it/~passerini/) and [Dr. Pasquale Minervini](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=9sk6CSgAAAAJ&hl=it) on trustworthy NLP. My primary research focuses include Explainability, Robustness, and Truthfulness of Multimodal Language Models. I did my master's under the supervision of [Dr. Pasquale Minervini](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=9sk6CSgAAAAJ&hl=it) and [Dr. Paolo Torroni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uOZZjwsAAAAJ) from the University of Bologna, Italy.
